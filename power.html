    <p> As the NBA season is nearing towards the end, many teams have began hot streaks and have been playing some of their best basketball of the season. The 1 seed, 76ers, have stayed consistent over the course of the season and have proved they are serious title contenders after a dissapointing early exit last season. The Clippers fall to the 2nd seed as they have continued to play well, but the 76ers have been on a whole new level. The Suns have also fell to the the 3rd seed. A big story is last years champions, the Lakers, who have fallen all the way to the 9 seed as they continue to struggle without Lebron James or Anthony Davis. They are hoping just to stay in the playoff picture so their 2 best players can come back well rested and ready for playoff time as they seek to become back to back champions.
