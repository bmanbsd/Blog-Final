 <p>Golden State Warrior Point Guard or considered by may as the greatest shooter ever, Steph Curry, has broken the record for most 3 pointers in a month with 85. The record was originally held by James Harden who had 82 3 pointers in a month. Curry has been on a historical hot streak this month averaging 38 points per game as the Warriors make a push for the playoffs finishing the month of April 10-2. The Warriors and Curry have had a dissapointing season so far but this last push sparks a sign of life for the team and their fanbase. There is no better time to heat up than the end of the season as playoffs are near. Curry already holds the top three records for most 3 pointers in a season and is well on his way to breaking the all time 3 point record. Will Curry be able to continue his hot streak into the playoffs or will the Warriors once again end with a dissapointing season? Click link above for additional details.</p>
