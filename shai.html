 <p>Oklahoma City Thunder point guard, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, has missed the past several games with a foot injury. He was expected to return this week but has been set back another 2 weeks after his injury has shown lack of improvemnt. Shai has had an outstanding 3rd year averaging 22 points per game. The Thunder have struggled without him going 4 and 6 in their last 10 games. Coach Daigneault stated:“He’s definitely progressed, but not to the point we would have liked. He’s probably a little bit behind what we were looking for.” Do the Thunder still have a chance to make the playoffs with the return of Shai? They are currently the 11 seed in the Western Conference and sit 6 games behind playoff contention. They will have to make a push to make it and maybe with the return of Shai, it is possible.
