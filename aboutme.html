  <p2>A couple hobbies I personally enjoy are basketball and video games. My entire life I was taught and trained to be a hockey player, but I never really liked it. In 2018, i found the love of my life, basketball. Ever since then, I've put my all into this sport and love it. I try to play it everyday but because of corona and the struggles to find open gyms, I haven't been able to play that much recently. Secondly, video games. I've played Video games my entire life and always found it as a great way to connect with people from all over the world. I will continue to love them as they continue to bring me joy.</p2>

  <p2>Family is very important to me. I love my family. I have a dad, a mom, 2 sisters and a dog, but my family goes bigger than that. My mom is the 3rd child of 7! My mom's massive family has led me to have 23 cousins and counting! My dad's side is a little smaller, where I only have 2 cousins. Every summer, I go away to New Jersey for 2 weeks with my mom's side of the family and my cousins. It's always a blast as we go down to the beach everyday and swim or play soccer. There is also a basketball court just across the street from the house we stay at. After those 2 weeks, I go to Pittsburgh for 4 weeks where all my cousins are also from and I continue to see them and to have fun. Overall I couldn't ask for a better family. </p2>

  <p2>Today, I am in secondary 4 at Loyola High School. I continue to live in Montreal West with my parents as my sisters have moved onto University and are not home. Obviously sports have not have not been avalaible so I've been making busy by getting out when I can, playing video games, working out and I now have a girlfriend. I've been fine throughout the entire pandemic and I have continued to stay focused on my priorities. I am very excited for summer and hopefully being able to go see my cousins in the States once again. </p2>
