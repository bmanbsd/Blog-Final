 <p> Los Angeles Laker star Anthony Davis finally made his higly anticipated return on April 24 against the Dallas Mavericks. There were many questions going in to this game about his health and whether he truly was ready to return. Anthony Davis seemed rusty in his return finishing only with 17 points and shooting 5 of 19 from the field. Davis claimed his injury did not temper with his game at all as he stated "I didn't think about it one time tonight." Maybe Davis is telling the truth and just has to brush some of the rust off. Even with these comments, many continue to question the Lakers health staff and their judgement. The Lakers did take a loss and Davis' return was spoiled by a sensational game from Luka Doncic who finished with a double double. Davis is looking to bounce back as the Lakers will face the Orlando Magic on April 26th. Click link above for additional details.</p>
