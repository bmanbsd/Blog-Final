 <p>The NBA MVP race is always one of the tighest award races in the NBA and the same has followed this year. Denver Nuggets Center Nikola Jokic is currently leading the race. Jokic has proved many of the doubters wrong as he has continued to lead the Nuggets to a great spot in the standings in a very competitive Western Conference. The Nuggets have continued to remain in the playoff race even after their point guard Jamal Muray suffered a seaon ending ACL injury. Jokic is slimly followed by brooklyn Nets Guard James Harden who was traded from the Houston Rockets earlier this season and has proved he can be put in any system and lead a team to the playoffs. In 3rd place is Philadelphia 76ers Center Joel Embiid who has led his team to one of the top records in the NBA. Will Jokic take home the award or will some players rise to the occasion and make one last push for the MVP. Click link above for additional details. </p>
